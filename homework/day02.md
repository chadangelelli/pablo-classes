# Homework

1. Spend literally as much time as possible just playing around in VI/Neovim (minimo un hora por dia)
2. Write some .js files (named anything) in src/day02 and run them using "node FILENAME.js" (minimo 3 .js file-os)


# NOTES

- add file to Git: "git add ." or "git add FILENAME"
- save file in Git ("committing"): "git commit -a" or "git commit FILENAME"
- saving files to Git (remotely to share) ("pushing"): "git push origin main"
